# Covid19-Space-time-analysis
 Covid19 data space-time visualization by pyechart<br>
This project is for the visualization of COVID-19 epidemic data. Based on the python programming language, it mainly uses the "pyechart" open source package to visualize the COVID-19 data released by Johns Hopkins University (the data is placed under the "data" folder).<br>

The generated content (examples are placed under the "product" folder) includes:<br>
①Time series map of the number of CDRs in the COVID-19 epidemic,<br>
②National COVID-19 full-time epidemic data,<br>
③Dynamic data of the top 20 CDRs in the global Covid-19 epidemic,<br>
④Global major 3D histogram of the number of people diagnosed with COVID-19 in the country,<br>
⑤ histogram of the dynamic COVID-19 data of major countries in the world.<br>
